Use a DAQ and an inductive sensor to detect an aluminum can, which upon detection will increase a counter (without bounce) from 00 by one to the value indicated by the professor on two 7-segment displays.
 
At the same time the object is detected (at any time) it must count it and a servomotor must be activated turning an angle of 90° and return to 0° when the object is no longer detected, (you can use Arduino for this part).
 
If you pass the object 3 times continuously, you should count it 3 times and activate the motor the same 3 times.
 
To check that it only detects metal, place a PET bottle in front of the sensor, the counter don’t increase and not move the motor.
 
To verify that it uses the DAQ, when it is disconnected the system no longer works correctly.
 
Make a PCB for two 7-segments displays (don’t use punch card) designed by the team with a legible image and the legible names of all students.
 
Don´t use breadboard or punch card in the system, you can design and make other PCBs.
