# Final Project

1. One member of each team submits on time a project report in free format and content of at least 10 pages, including specifications, project development and individual conclusions without spelling errors. It also includes your project VI file with its group and names on the front panel.
2. The project is implemented on a conveyor belt and works correctly using an arduino-based data acquisition board or the team's own microcontroller with a LabVIEW-based system (doesn´t use DAQ).
3. The project uses an inductive sensor to detect an aluminum can, which upon detecting it will increase by one a counter from 00 to the value indicated by the professor in two 7-segment displays. 
4. At the same time as the object is detected and counted, a servomotor must be activated by turning an angle of 90° and return to 0° when the object is no longer detected.
5. To verify that only detects metal, include a PET bottle and doesn’t count it and doesn’t move the motor.
6. The Project doesn’t use breadboard, uses at least one PCBs designed by the team and includes the design in the report.
