## Unit 1
1. P01_HELLO: Write a code in C language that prints the text "Hello world!" on the screen.

2. P02_READ_WRITE: Write a code in C that obtains the square of a number entered by the user.
Code using printf and scanf
Code using cin and cout

3. P03_IF_ELSE: Write a code in C that obtains the greater or equal of 2 or 3 numbers using IF

4. P04_WHILE: Determine the divisors of a number using WHILE structure.

5. P05_FOR: Determine the factorial of a number using a FOR structure

6. P06_CASE: Do a menu using a CASE structure
	* SECTION B: Design the following systems using LabVIEW, screenprint the Front Panel and Block Diagram and insert them into their corresponding cell:

7. P07_BUFFER: Do a VI that sends 8 bits using 8 switches in a DIPSW8 and displayed in 8 LEDs in a LEDBAR. https://youtu.be/yuHvMNgLfqg

8. P08_ANALOG: Do a VI to acquire a virtual analog signal from 0 to 5V visualizing it in a CHART with Sweep Update Mode and saving the values automatically in a text file using nodes.

9. P09_D7SEG: Do a VI to decode 4 bits to 7 segments from 0 to 9 using subVI D7SEG. Do a subVI of a decoder to 7 segments from 0 to 9 using a numerical control limited in integers from 0 to 9.

10. P10_BLINK: Do a VI that modifies the blinking speed of a LED using a numerical control.
	* Blink with Flat Sequence
	* Blink with Case

11. P11_SEQUENCE: Do a VI that changes the direction and speed with two controls (one Boolean and another numeric) of a sequence in a LED from one side to the other in 4 bits, verify that it does not have "jumps" in the sequence.

12. P12_TRAFFIC_LIGHTS: Do a VI that generates the sequence of the crossing of a street with 2 traffic lights, the system does not contain controls. https://youtu.be/vnJVmljgSZo

13. P13_TOGGLE: Do a VI for the enclave of a LED using a PUSHBUTTON. 

14. P14_RANDOM: Do a VI that generates a random number from 1 to 6 every second and display it on a dice made by the user, showing only the corresponding LEDs. https://youtu.be/9P595IWX-vE

15. P15_TEMP: Do a VI that shows in a THERMOMETER indicator the values generated with the subVI TEMP and save the values in an excel file using nodes, include a LED which will light when the temperature exceeds 32 ° C, define a convenient time constant.  Do a subVI that generates a random signal in the range of 30 to 35 °C each time interval defined by the user using a numerical control KNOB.

16. P16_COUNT: Create a system that performs the cyclic count of 10 objects, obtaining the signal that increases the count with a virtual button (without bounce) and display it in a single virtual 7-segment display. Include a virtual button to reset the counter to 0 any time it is pressed. https://youtu.be/tDUex919vng
